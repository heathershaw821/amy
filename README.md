## Information Collection

Amy includes a comprehensive set of tools to collect and process information from text. These capabilities are designed for moderation, filtering, and enriching the user experience. Hereâ€™s an overview of what Amy can collect and how it processes data:

### Information Types

| Type                     | Description                                                                                   |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Card Information**     | Detects and processes card details like number, type, and status.                             |
| **Darknet Links**         | Identifies `.onion` addresses commonly used on the dark web.                                  |
| **Pastebin Links**        | Extracts raw content from supported pastebin-like services.                                   |
| **Contact Information**   | Recognizes email addresses and other contact details.                                        |
| **Web Links**             | Detects URLs, IP addresses, and specific services like YouTube.                              |

### How It Works

1. **Pattern Matching**: 
   Amy uses a set of regular expressions to identify specific patterns in text, such as:
   - Credit card numbers (`\b[0-9]{16}\b`)
   - Email addresses (`[A-Z0-9_.+-]+@[A-Z0-9-]+\.[A-Z0-9-.]+`)
   - URLs (`(?:http|ftp|git|irc)s?://...`)
   - Darknet `.onion` addresses.

2. **Data Processing**: 
   Detected information is passed through corresponding handlers, which can:
   - Validate the data (e.g., Luhn's algorithm for card numbers).
   - Fetch additional metadata (e.g., using YouTubeâ€™s oEmbed API).
   - Retrieve and screen content (e.g., from Pastebin).

3. **Queue System**:
   Amy uses a multi-threaded queue to handle data processing efficiently in real-time.

4. **JSON Integration**:
   Processed information is structured into JSON format for easy handling and potential logging.

### Example Configurations

Sample regular expressions and handlers are defined in `handlers`:

```python
self.card_handlers = {
    r"\b[0-9]{16}\b": self.ccn_handler,
    r"\b(DEBIT|CREDIT)\b": lambda x: {"card_account": [y.lower() for y in x]},
    ...
}
```

## Configuration

Amy is configured via a JSON file, `config.json`. Hereâ€™s a sample:

```json
{
    "irc.hackermeme.net": {
        "channels": ["#cmd", "#design", "#hackermeme", "#music"],
        "prefix": "amy!amy@localhost",
        "sslflag": false,
        "port": 6667,
        "mods": {
            "heather": ["o", "<PASSWORD-HASH>"],
            "epoch": ["o", "<PASSWORD-HASH>"],
            "alice": ["o", "<PASSWORD-HASH>"],
            "bunny": ["o", "<PASSWORD-HASH>"],
            "uniquelyelite": ["h", "<PASSWORD-HASH>"]
        }
    }
}
```

### Configuration Notes
- **Server Settings**: Define the IRC server, channels, and connection options.
- **Moderators**: Use hashed passwords to manage access levels:
  - `"o"`: Operator privileges.
  - `"h"`: Half-op privileges.
